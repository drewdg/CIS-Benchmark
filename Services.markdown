# 2 Services

## 2.1 inetd Services

inetd is a super-server daemon that provides internet services and passes connections to
configured services. While not commonly used inetd and any unneeded inetd based
services should be disabled if possible.

## 2.1.1 Ensure xinetd is not installed

#### Profile Applicability:
* Level 1 - Server
* Level 1 - Workstation

#### Description:
The eXtended InterNET Daemon ( <code>xinetd</code> ) is an open source super daemon that replaced
the original <code>inetd</code> daemon. The <code>xinetd</code> daemon listens for well known services and
dispatches the appropriate daemon to properly respond to service requests.

#### Rationale:
If there are no <code>xinetd</code> services required, it is recommended that the package be removed.

#### Audit:
Run the following command to verify <code>xinetd</code> is not installed:
<pre><code># pkg info xinetd
pkg: No package(s) matching xinetd</code></pre>

#### Remediation:
Run the following command to remove xinetd:
<pre><code># pkg delete xinetd</code></pre>

#### CIS Controls:

9.2 Ensure Only Approved Ports, Protocols and Services Are Running
Ensure that only network ports, protocols, and services listening on a system with
validated business needs, are running on each system.

## 2.2 Special Purpose Services

This section describes services that are installed on systems that specifically need to run
these services. If any of these services are not required, it is recommended that they be
disabled or deleted from the system to reduce the potential attack surface.
