Issues:

Services:
2.2.1.1 - Is Chrony setup needed? I included a ntpd setup, should I also have a section for installing/configuring chrony?
2.2.2 - SMTP - should smtp be disabled? or set to send-only?

Network Configuration:
(3.1.2) packet redirect sending - Is this possible on FreeBSD?
(3.2.3) Ensure secure ICMP redirects are not accepted - Neither inet6(4) or inet(4) have this parameter, is this doable with anything else?
(3.2.6) Ensure bogus ICMP responses are ignored - No option on FreeBSD
(3.2.7) Ensure Reverse Path Filtering is enabled - No option on freebsd

Auditing and Logging.
4.1.1.1  Ensure auditd is installed - Is there a way to check if auditd is installed? I know it's normally packages with the base OS
(4.1.1.3)  Ensure auditing for processes that start prior to auditd is enabled - Couldn't find any documentation on this.
(4.1.1.3)  Ensure audit_backlog_limit is sufficient - Can't find documentation on changing this in FreeBSD
(4.1.3) Ensure changes to system administration scope (sudoers) is collected - Is this possible on FreeBSD?

Cron/Perodic:
5.1.4 - Secure at/cron/periodic to authorized users - Does periodic have allow/deny files? Couldn't locate them.

SSH
5.2.20 Incorrect way of changing the variable -NEEDS FIXING (personal note)

(5.5.1.2) Ensure minimum days between password changes is 7 or more - No option for this in FreeBSD
5.5.1.2 - No option to switch warning for individual users
Ensure inactive password lock is 30 days or less - No option on FreeBSD
Ensure all users last password change date is in the past - No option on FreeBSD
Ensure system accounts are secured - No(?) direct translation to FreeBSD

PAM and Password Settings
(5.2.2)Ensure lockout for failed password attempts is configured - Not an option on FreeBSD
(5.2.3)Ensure password reuse is limited - No option on FreeBSD
